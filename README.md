* [Meet Our Guild Leads](#meet-our-guild-leads)

## Who We Are

The 2077 Collective was born out of a need to address a significant gap in the Ethereum ecosystem: its lack of a coordinated marketing and promotional strategy.

While Ethereum has a robust community of researchers and developers focused on building and scaling, it lacks a unified front to promote its brand and innovations - weâ€™re here to fix that.

## Our Motivation

The 2077 Collective is motivated by the need to address the marketing and perception challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem. Our goal is to build a consensus on the core marketing problems and develop public infrastructure to solve them. We aim to direct our marketing efforts effectively and increase the number of developers and businesses building on Ethereum. 

## Ways to Get Involved
